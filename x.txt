### Task: Reduce API calls  Currently, the playbook is making multiple unnecessary query API calls during its execution. These redundant calls are leading to increased network traffic, slower performance, and potential rate-limiting issues, especially when the playbook is triggered frequently or used at scale.  Upon reviewing the code, it appears that some API queries are being repeated even though the data is already available in memory or fetched earlier in the flow. This not only adds latency but also increases the risk of inconsistent data if responses vary slightly over time.  ### Impact: - Unnecessary network overhead - Slower user experience - Higher load on backend services - Potential API rate limit breaches  ### Suggested Fix: - Identify and eliminate repeated or redundant API calls. - Ensure any necessary calls are made only once per execution flow.  ### Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open the playbook. 2. Update or add a window function or add filters in filter group. 3. Observe the network tab or API logs to see repeated calls to the same endpoint(s).  ### Expected Behavior: Each required API call should be made only once per context.  ### Issue Link: [View Issue #942](https://github.com/silzila/silzila-saas-frontend/issues/942)
